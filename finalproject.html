       		<h1>Background & Information</h1>
       		<p>The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League started in 1943 after men 18+ were drafted into war, so women took their places. The AAGPBL was started by Philip K. Wrigley because he was concerned that men's MLB would suffer when players would be called out for service to the military. The league was flourishing, but in 1954, people started losing interest in the games, and the AAGPBL came to its end.</p>
